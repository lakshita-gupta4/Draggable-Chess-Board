# Draggable-Chess-Board
This project is a simple interactive chessboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a fully initialized 8Ã—8 chessboard with draggable chess pieces, styled to resemble a classic board. Users can pick up and move any piece freely across the board using drag-and-drop functionality.
